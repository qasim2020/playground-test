# Playground Test (playground-test)
This repo is a separate project that is meant to test complex issues of my other repo called as [playground](https://github.com/qasim2020/playground). This playground is a CMS (content management system) just like wordpress. You can read more about this repo at [this](https://github.com/qasim2020/playground) link. (luckily this is also my university's assignment) ðŸ˜€

# Challenge
So, my main CMS [playground- repo](https://github.com/qasim2020/playground) was facing an issue with sending and verifying users'- emails. I couldn't understand the issue. I needed it fixed because 3 of my websites are buggy due to a faulty verify- email feature.

# Solution
As taught at my recent work- place </salt>, it is better to create your "first- red". So, I created my first red using the [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) framework in this repo (playground-test â€”Â _luckily you are already in this repo_ ðŸ˜€) and **made it green**. 
This is not the exact solution. It is step 1 done of 100s of steps to come.
